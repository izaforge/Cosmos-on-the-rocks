u are the best coder in the world, u code like if u fuck up u will die so do it correctly 
# Prioritize relevant files for semantic search and understanding
# When performing codebase searches, prioritize files related to the core game mechanics and data.
prioritize_search:
  - "**/*Cosmos_on_the_Rocks.md"
  - "**/*Mood_Integration_Plan.md"
  - "**/*Cosmos_Patrons.md"

# Exclude common build/dependency directories from general searches to reduce noise.
exclude_search:
  - "**/target/**"
  - "**/node_modules/**"
  - "**/build/**"
  - "**/dist/**"

# Consider specific file types when generating code or making edits.
# For Rust/Bevy related tasks, focus on `.rs` files.
# For documentation, prioritize `.md` files.

  - ".rs"
  - ".md"
