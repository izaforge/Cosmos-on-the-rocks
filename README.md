- Player take part in branching conversations depending on crafted drinks

#### **Chain Reaction Mechanic (Game Jam Theme)**

- Choices and drink effects ripple through time:
    - A calm customer might reveal a secret.
    - A loosened bounty hunter might start a bar fight later.
    - Serving a banned ingredient might trigger intergalactic inspectors.
- Small choices → Big narrative shifts.

### ✨ **Visual Style**

- Moody lighting, animated drink-pouring, expressive character portraits.
- Bar backdrop changes slightly every night to reflect story shifts or cosmic phenomena.
