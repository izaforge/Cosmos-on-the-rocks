Bartending game made in Bevy for Game Jam 6

**Setting:** A bar orbiting a black hole or floating at a galactic crossroads. Drifters, bounty hunters, AIs, rebels, and aliens pass through.
**Player Role:** Bartender who mixes drinks and chats with customers. You're also subtly manipulating events by what you serve and say.

### ðŸŽ® **Core Gameplay Loops**

#### 1. **Drink Mixing (Inspired by "Bartender: The Right Mix")**

- Player selects ingredients to make drinks.
- Each drink has effects on the customerâ€™s mood, memory, or behavior (e.g., loosened tongues, calmed nerves).
- Better drinks = better tips / trust / dialogue outcomes.

#### 2. **Dialogue & Relationships (Inspired by "Dynopunk")**

- Engage in branching conversations.
- Dialogue options influenced by:
    - The drink served.
    - Previous interactions.
    - The customer's current mental state(they all have their own stories and things happen in their lives which our character has o react to).

#### 3. **Chain Reaction Mechanic (Game Jam Theme)**

- Choices and drink effects ripple through time:
    - A calm customer might reveal a secret.
    - A loosened bounty hunter might start a bar fight later.
    - Serving a banned ingredient might trigger intergalactic inspectors.
- Small choices â†’ Big narrative shifts.

### ðŸ§© **Structure & Progression**

- **Nightly Shifts:** Each session is one night with new and recurring patrons.
- **Patron Arcs:** Each has a mini-plotline, secret, or problem. Help them over time.
- **Bar Events:** Randomized chain reactions trigger between customers or factions (e.g., love triangles, vendettas, alliances).
- **Meta Progression:** Unlock new ingredients, decor, and secrets about the bar and its mysterious location.

### ðŸŒŒ **Characters & Factions**

- Alien Mobster with a soft spot for Earth jazz.
- Rogue AI trying to pass as human.
- Galactic Peace Officer always one drink away from snapping.
- Mysterious regular who never speaksâ€”until you serve the right combo.

### âœ¨ **Visual Style**

- 2D pixel art or stylized cartoon aesthetic.
- Moody lighting, animated drink-pouring, expressive character portraits.
- Bar backdrop changes slightly every night to reflect story shifts or cosmic phenomena.

### ðŸ”— **"Chain Reaction" Specific Ideas**

- **Reactive Patrons:** One customer reacting to anotherâ€™s drink or outburst.
- **Timeline Echoes:** Past nights' choices haunting you (e.g., ghost patrons, time loop anomalies).
- **Factional Chain:** Factions react to how you treat their members; e.g., helping a rebel might make bounty hunters hostile.
