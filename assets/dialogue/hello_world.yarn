Bartender: (sighs, adjusting his optical sensors) Another shift alone. I miss old Jax. He always knew how to handle the rowdy ones.
Bartender: This whole station's a mess without him. And this bar... it's a floating rock in the void, but it's home.
Bartender: Time for a pick-me-up. Something strong, for a long night.

Bartender: (clink of ice, a whirring sound) Perfect. Just like Jax taught me. Hope he's out there somewhere, sipping on something just as good.
